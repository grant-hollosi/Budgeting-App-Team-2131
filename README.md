# Status of Funds App
- Problem: The leadership of the 75th Army Ranger Regiment do not have full access to GFEBS, a database that serves to keep track of their transaction history and budget. 
- Solution: An iOS app that allows those without access to GFEBS to view, but not modify, the transaction history, budget, and their various graphs of the 75th Army Ranger Regiment.
- App Info: The app will permit the user to view the Regiment’s financial data and history from the convenience of their smartphone. The user groups are those who can view the data, and those who can view and upload more data. <br /><br />

## Installation

1. The first step towards installation of the app requires opening the Terminal and going to the directory (file) of the app downloaded from GitHub. To begin, go to the search bar and open the Terminal app.  

2. In the finder, open the folder labeled “Budgeting-App-Team-2131-master” and right click on the folder in it labeled “Status-Of-Funds-App”. Hold down the option button on your keyboard and then select the choice: Copy “Status-Of-Funds-App" as Pathname. This will copy the full path of the file in your computer. 

<img width="917" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 2 23 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206075548-84bbf585-0c24-4259-a64c-d32a04c5b543.png">

3. Now, back to the terminal, type in the command “cd [pathname you copied]”.  It should look something like this: 

<img width="974" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 2 30 31 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206075609-e3b5c532-8083-459e-b8c3-587abdb63318.png">

4. Press enter. You should now be in the correct directory of the project code. To confirm this, type in the command “ls” in the terminal (lowercase L then s). 

<img width="1018" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 2 32 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206075695-43b36c47-63c2-4a7c-9082-18641418a93d.png">

5. Next, run the command “npm i”. This should install all the necessary packages that are part of the application. If an error appears that asks to run the command “npm audit fix”, then do so accordingly. 

6. The next step is to compile the app for XCode. To do this, run these commands in the order that they appear: 

> rm -r "./www" 

> rm -r "./ios" 

> ionic build 

> npx cap add ios 

> npx cap open ios

7. This process may take a few minutes. 

8. A screen should appear that looks like the one pictured below. This is the XCode application. 

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 6 21 48 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206075863-603fc285-5fbf-4c9e-93a3-f31be02e4448.png">

9. Click on the “App” segment on the left-hand side. A new screen should appear:

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 6 34 37 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206075919-70d5dbdc-67ce-488a-bdc3-0b51ebbcce9e.png">

10. Click on the tab labeled “Signing & Capabilities”, then click on the button labeled “Add Account...” Sign in with an Apple ID in order to add an account for deploying the app. Now, set the team to be the account that was just signed in with instead of “None”.

<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206077534-a3dc7b99-da3e-4bab-89c6-fdf2861a570b.png">

11. If an error appears with the message saying “There are no devices registered in your account on the developer website”, it is now time to plug in an iPhone device. 

12. Once plugged in, head to the top of the page and click on “Window”, then select the option “Devices and Simulators”. If a message appears saying that the iPhone is not paired with the computer, simply go to the iPhone and select Trust when a prompt appears to trust the computer. Wait a few minutes for XCode to install debugger support to the phone.

<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206076566-a6255cdd-e39f-44c4-9afd-4e34bcc69820.png">

13. Now, in the part labeled “Bundle Identifier”, type in a unique string for the application. An example can be “Status-Of-Funds-App" (If that does not work, try changing the string to something else). 

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 6 58 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206076668-6e350f89-47cc-4b22-b3a9-fde94f6761b3.png">

14. After this, click on the devices next to the part labeled “App” on the top (From the screenshot, click on the part where “iPhone 14 Pro” is present). Then select the iOS device that will have the app downloaded to it.   

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 6 55 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206076719-9a7e80dc-072c-4b40-96ef-699bd2b9f9b4.png">

15. Now it is time to click the run button in order to install the app to the phone. 

<img width="917" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 7 14 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206077827-e00df56f-c204-44fc-b7cf-6829effd293a.png">

16. Note, on the iPhone it may be necessary to enable developer mode. It is not possible to install the app without this setting enabled. To enable this on an iPhone, go to Settings > Privacy & Security and at the very bottom of the page a Developer Mode tab should be there. Open that and then select to enable it. 

17. A prompt on the Mac device may show up multiple times that looks like this the screen below. Just keep typing in the Mac device password in order to continue. 

<img width="502" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 7 05 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55679464/206076913-59e294ab-7c36-4ab8-b729-fd9f7b7f53ec.png">

* The link above provides how to setup the various services on AWS, please send an email to [srajan39@gatech.edu](mailto:srajan39@gatech.edu) if you have any further questions. 

## Conclusion

* The app should now be installed on the iPhone. Note, it is not necessary to do this whole process for every iPhone. Just begin from the step where the original iPhone was first plugged in. 

* If any problems arise, please send an email to [jporter74@gatech.edu](mailto:jporter74@gatech.edu) in order to troubleshoot.
